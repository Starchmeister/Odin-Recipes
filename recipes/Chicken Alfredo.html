      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Chicken alfredo is a classic favoriteâ€”a creamy white sauce, long strands of pasta mixed with tender pieces of lean protein.</p>
      <p>It's the classic pasta we just can't seem to get enough of. Of course there are tons of jarred pasta sauces you can buy, but making <br /> alfredo sauce from scratch is actually so easy.</p>
